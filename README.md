# TriangularDodger_cae
/*
The project was changed to RectangularDodger because I changed the object to a rectangle.
Version 1 of my project is a rectangle being able to move with
UP, DOWN, RIGHT and LEFT keys.
There is a randomization of color for the rectangle.
Version 2 for my project wish list is to be able to get a CPU moving randomly in the frame or an AI that follows your object.
Also I wanted to get a random button for color and maybe a reset function.
Lastly I wanted to get a remove function for the CPU or AI to remove your object from play if touched. To implement the AI I need a thread but I don't know if I need it for randomly moving CPU.
Right now I dont know if I can get all of these. I mght be able to get the random moving CPU and color randomization button but the AI and reset function might be trickier.
Also, I did try to do the AI and left it within this submission but commented out the code for a proper run of the program.
